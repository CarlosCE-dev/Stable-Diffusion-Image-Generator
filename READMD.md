## Usage
The basic functionality of this project is to get random images based on random props provided by this app. This project contains a lot of useful tags when generating a image with the txt2img functionality of Stable Diffusion.

#### Using random prop generator
After running your program you can access the url of the project to generate random images. Each time you access the home page of this application it will create a image with Stable Diffusion (with random props). Each time you reload the page a new image will be created. All the images will be save in this application in the following route `./tmp/uploads`.

#### Using discord bot
Before using this functionality you must create your own discord bot. Follow the basic setup of a bot in this guide: [discord.js bot guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin).
When you bot is configure correctly in your discord server you can use the following commands:

| Commands | Description                                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| image    | Generate images based on tags                   |
| random   | Generate image based on random character traits |
